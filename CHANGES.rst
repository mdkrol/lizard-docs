Changelog for the Lizard documentation
======================================

0.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- Started the new documentation project based on the 3Di documentation setup.

- Configured automatic builds on readthedocs.com so that we won't have
  advertisements. So: we're supporting readthedocs (which is a good thing).

- We're tested automatically on travis-ci.com.
