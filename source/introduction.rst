Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation of Lizard. 

Lizard is a webbased portal, containing the following:


**Assets**: water-related objects such as pump stations, levees, polders, measuringstations etc. 

**Timeseries**: water-related sequences of measurements with metadata. Measurements may be aggregated for fast retrieval. Timeseries also contain metadata and have a relationship with a location.

**Locations**: contain the geo metadata of timeseries and may be related to an asset.

**Rasters**: geospatially continuous, optionally time-varying, scalar or categorized gridded data; for example: digital elevation models, flood depths, radar precipitation measurements, satellite imagery, landcover classification, etc.
