================

Via the URL www.{yourorganisation}.lizard.net/management/users/ you can manage the user roles.

.. note::
	You can only do this if you are a manager of the organisation. Usually, there is one member of the organisation a manager, or we (Nelen & Schuurmans) manage the roles by request.

Roles
--------------- 

We have 4 roles and 3 different types of privileges. 

1. A **user**, who can only *read* data
2. A **supplier**, who can *read* data and change (*'write'*) his or her own data
3. An **administator**, who can *read* data and change (*'write'*) all organisation's data. 
4. A **manager**, who can *manage* other roles in the organisation. A manager can not read or write data by default. This role should be appointed separately. 

	
Existing users

On the user management page, you see the an overview of the users and their roles. These are sorted by organisation. You can change one user's role by clicking the “edit roles“ button, make the changes and then click the “save“ button.

After clicking the 'New User' button you will find the form to add new users. Here, you need to fill in the username and emailadress, a first and last name. Default the “User“ role is selected. Using the other buttons will select or deselect other roles.
After you click 'Save', an activation email will be send to the user.

.. tip::
	In order to keep your users organised, we advise to choose a system of either picking the username based on the emailadress before the @, or the format {firstname.lastname} . 


Frequently asked questions	
---------------------------


  
*"Someone with the role “User” can only see the data but not add or modify them, and with the role “Supplier” you can add and modify them, right? Can you see data of the organisation if you only have the role of writing?"*

- Yes, yes and yes. If you can write you can automatically see as well. 

*"Furthermore, as a reader, can you see data from other users in the organisation?"*

- Yes, everything from the organisation, as well as public data from other organisations. 

*"And as a writer, can you add data to assets added by other users in the organisation? (for example, if another user adds a monitoring station, and I, as a writer, add groundwater level measurements to it). I guess it is like that, otherwise it would be the same as being a supplier, right? "*

- Yes!    
   
*"Which role is the most powerful?"*

- An administrator is the most powerful when it comes to data management, but a manager is actually the most powerful, as it can make itself an administrator and take other administrator's rights.
