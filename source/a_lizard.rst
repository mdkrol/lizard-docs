Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation of Lizard. 

Lizard is a data integration platform for data on the physical environment. Lizard opens up new possibilities to integrate spatially distributed timeseries and geodata, allowing you to transform data into informed decisions.

One can describe the physical environment with data. In essence you need three types of data: time series, rasters and vectors. Lizard's databases are especially built for storing, accelerating and integrating these three types of data:

**Assets**: physical objects e.g. pump stations, groundwater stations, polders, measuring stations and parcels. 

**Timeseries**: timeseries describing the physical environment, related to an Asset. E.g. water levels, growth stages, hydraulic head or temperature.

**Rasters**: (temporal) raster data; e.g.: digital elevation models, flood depths, model results, radar precipitation measurements, satellite imagery and landcover classification.
